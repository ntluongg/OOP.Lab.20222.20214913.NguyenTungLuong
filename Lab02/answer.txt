Since we can only oveload constructors with same name but different signatures:
- Numbers of arguments are different.
- If the numbers of arguments are the same, types of
arguments must be different.
So if you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category
it will raise an error because category and title are of the same type.
